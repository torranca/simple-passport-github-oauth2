# express-4.x-google-oauth2-example

This example illustrates how to use [Express](https://expressjs.com) 4.x and
[Passport](https://www.passportjs.org) to sign users in with [Google](https://www.google.com).
Use this example as a starting point for your own web applications.

## Quick Start

To get started with this example, clone the repository and install the
dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:passport/express-4.x-google-oauth2-example.git
$ cd express-4.x-google-oauth2-example
$ npm install
```

This example requires credentials from Google, which can be obtained by [setting
up](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#appsetup)
a project in [Google APIs console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/).
The redirect URI of the OAuth client should be set to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback`

Once credentials have been obtained, create a `.env` file and add the following
environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID={{INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE}}
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET={{INSERT_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE}}
```

Start the server.

```bash
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Overview

This example illustrates how to use [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org) and
the [`passport-google-oauth20`](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-google-oauth20/)
strategy within an [Express](https://expressjs.com) application to sign users in
with [Google](https://www.google.com).

The example builds upon the scaffolding created by [Express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html),
and uses [EJS](https://ejs.co) as a view engine and plain CSS for styling.  This
scaffolding was generated by executing:

```
$ express --view ejs express-4.x-google-oauth2-example
```

The example uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) for storing user accounts.
SQLite is a lightweight database that works well for development, including this
example.

Added to the scaffolding are files which add authentication to the application.

* [`boot/db.js`](boot/db.js)

  This file initializes the database by creating the tables used to store user
  accounts and credentials.

* [`boot/auth.js`](boot/auth.js)

  This file initializes Passport.  It configures the Google strategy and
  supplies the serialization functions used for session management.

* [`routes/auth.js`](routes/auth.js)

  This file defines the routes used for authentication.  In particular, there
  are three routes used to authenticate with Google:
  
  - `GET /login`
  
    This route renders a page that prompts the user to sign in with Google.
  
  - `GET /login/federated/accounts.google.com`
  
    This route begins the authentication sequence by redirecting the user to
    Google.
  
  - `POST /auth/github/callback`
  
    This route completes the authentication sequence when Google redirects the
    user back to the application.  When a new user signs in, a user account is
    automatically created and their Google account is linked.  When an existing
    user returns, they are signed in to their linked account.
